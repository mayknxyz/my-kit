## Microcopy Guidelines

### Button Labels

| Bad | Good | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Submit | Send Message | Specific action |
| Click Here | View Portfolio | Descriptive |
| OK | Confirm Booking | Clear outcome |
| Yes / No | Delete / Keep | Action-oriented |

### Error Messages

```
Bad:  "Error 422"
Good: "Please enter a valid email address"

Bad:  "Something went wrong"
Good: "We couldn't send your message. Please try again."

Bad:  "Invalid input"
Good: "Phone number must include area code (e.g., 09123456789)"
```

### Empty States

```
Bad:  "No data"
Good: "No messages yet. Start a conversation by reaching out to a client."
```

Pattern: **What happened** + **What to do next**

## CTA Best Practices

- **Action verb first**: "Get Started", "Schedule a Call", "View Our Work"
- **Be specific**: "Download the Guide" not "Learn More"
- **Create urgency** (when genuine): "Book Your Free Consultation"
- **One primary CTA per section** — avoid choice paralysis
- **Contrast button** for primary, subtle for secondary

## Landing Page Structure

1. **Hero**: Clear value proposition + primary CTA
2. **Problem**: Pain points your audience faces
3. **Solution**: How you solve it (features/services)
4. **Social proof**: Testimonials, logos, case studies, stats
5. **Process**: How it works (3-4 steps)
6. **CTA repeat**: Reinforce the action
7. **FAQ**: Address objections

## Tone

- Professional but approachable — not corporate stiff
- Confident, not arrogant — "We build" not "We're the best"
- Clear over clever — avoid puns and jargon
- Active voice — "We design websites" not "Websites are designed by us"
- Second person — "Your business" not "The business"

## MUST DO

- Use action verbs for all buttons and CTAs
- Write error messages that explain what happened AND what to do
- Include helpful empty states with next-step guidance
- Follow hero → problem → solution → proof → CTA structure
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max for web)
- Use specific, benefit-driven headlines

## MUST NOT

- Use jargon or technical terms in user-facing copy
- Write walls of text — break into scannable sections
- Use passive voice in CTAs ("Be contacted by us")
- Use vague labels ("Click Here", "Submit", "Learn More")
- Skip error context — always tell users what to do next
- Use multiple competing CTAs in one section
